# pomodoro-extension

Classic pomodoro with 4 work-rest cycles of 25-5 minutes each.

This pomodoro was built with 2 objectives in mind:

1. Avoiding complexity. It follows a "Don't make me think" philosophy.

2. Clarity of the task at hand. At the start of each session you must type what you will work on.

The timer is built as an extension that works as a popup. It automatically starts working when you click on the icon.

# Current limitation:

The popup works only when it's open.
